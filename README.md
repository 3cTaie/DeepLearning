# Project Name: Traffic Signs Classification

## Introduction
Image classification of traffic signs using deep learning techniques. The project uses PyTorch and TensorFlow frameworks and performs model comparison for complex image classification tasks.

## Installation Guide
Before running the script, make sure that Python and the following dependent libraries are installed:
- numpy==1.25.2
- pandas==2.0.3
